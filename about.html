    As of right now I have very minimal coding/dev skills but hey we all begin somewhere right. My goals as for skills in dev/coding by the end of this course is to be able to completely code my own website with all the functonal links with out having to go look at google or ask someone for help. My goal by the end of the course is to be 100% job ready.
